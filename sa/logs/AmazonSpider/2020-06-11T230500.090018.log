              '2. The THX surround sound didn’t work for the past month I’ve '

              'controller has a switch to raise game volume and lower chat, or '
              'vice versa. I had them set on chat sound in the windows '
              'playback options and the surround didn’t work. I then plugged '
              'them in with the 3.5mm jack and oh woah, they sounded so much '
              'better. So with the jack plugged into the controller you have '
              'to select the speaker icon that says game ready not the headset '
              'one that says earphones, and then raise the volume on the '
              'controller for the game sounds and now surround sound works and '

              'in terms of sound quality. I was expecting more for a $80 '
              'dollars + tax product.',
              'I knew Razer to have a certain reputation... a good one. This '
              'headset appeared to tick all the right boxes and the initial '
              'quality seemed excellent as it performed very well connected to '
              'a PS4.',
              'Fast forward 4 months: the microphone is dead. Tested on '
              'multiple devices (PS4, PC, phone). And... of course this '
              'happened three weeks after the warranty expired. I guess there '
              'was a reason for being on sale. Very dissapointing.',
              'This headset is amazing, especially the THX effect that '
              'animates life out of games!',
              'Unfortunately, I was in game once and suddenly got disconnected '
              'from internet, the headset started buzzing so loud it startle '
              'the hell out of me. I had to disconnect and connect it again '
              "for that. I hope I don't face that kind of problems in the "
              'future.',
              'I purchased this headset for PC. It was comfortable. However, '
              'the sound is too quiet. I was fighting with it for an hour '
              'trying to get the sound just right, and when I finally did, the '
              'headphones stopped working all together. I tried '
              'troubleshooting with Razer itself, but that was useless as they '
              'told me to try plugging it in better. Overall I am returning '
              'the product for a full refund and going with a different brand.',
              'If you want to fully enjoy THX Audio and some other features on '
              'the headset (EQ, MIC..etc) you have to install and use Razer '
              "Synapse 3.0. I've had nothing but issues with Synapse, so much "
              'that I decided to return the headset.',
              'The problem was that more than half of the headset features on '
              'Synapse (THX option, EQ, MIC) would randomly stop working which '
              'was frustrating as hell. Let me explain, in Synapse under the '
              '"MIXER" tab you can select the audio output of each running '
              "application (example: https://i.imgur.com/N6xA2wu.png). It's a "
              "nice feature, the problem is that it doesn't work and would "
              'randomly stop detecting any running applications (example: '
              "https://i.imgur.com/l5kCO4o.png). That's not all, the "
              '"ENHANCEMENT" tab sliders would also randomly stop working and '
              'the worst of all the "Equalizer" sliders would also stop '
              'working for no reasons where moving the sliders or changing '
              'preset would do NOTHING.',
              "I've tried unplugging the headset, I tried different USB port "
              '(2.0 and 3.0), I tried re-installing Synapse, I made sure the '
              '"Game" speaker was set as default, I\'ve tried everything. The '
              'ONLY way to make the "MIXER" tab detect my applications or the '
              '"Equalizer" to work again was to restart my computer, then it '
              'would work for 10-15 minutes and then back to nothing. Very '
              "frustrating. I've been using Razer software for a years, I "
              'never had any issues but this is just god awful.',
              'Also, the MIC sensitivity is a bit messed up, within the '
              'Synapse applications the mic sound super good but then when you '
              "get to record yourself in Windows it's super low and the "
              'sensitivity is all messed up.',
              'I also spoke with someone else who purchased this headset and '
              "he's having the EXACT same issues as me (Mixer won't detect any "
              'apps, EQ would randomly stop working..etc) so I suspect this '
              "isn't such an isolated case...",
              'When it works it pretty good though, but the software, yikes...',
              "First 3 days of owning, but am IN LOVE. They're so light and "
              'soft on my head, I can play way too long and still not get '
              'weird sweaty ears. Sound is superb, microphone quality is great '
              '(I know because I purchased a pair for my friends).',
              "One thing of note is that they don't block out the sound of the "
              "space you're in. I like this because it means I can use "
              'speakers for game audio and headphones for party chat.'],

              'After the first use, I am in love with this. The handle feels '

              'run it down the item you want to peel and it does the rest with '

              'that those hard to peel curvy sweet potatoes. This peeler '
              'carves them up easily. Also I used it on a Jicama where other '
              'peelers have failed and this one did its bes to peel through. '

              'vegetable peeler and a coring tool but the coring ultimately '
              'did it in. I guess the years of use and the additional leverage '
              'used to pry out potato eyes and insect holes in hard fruit like '
              'apples and pears was just too much for it and the price of '
              'replacing it with the same tool was just way too expensive. We '
              'opted for doing it with two tools and this was one of them and '
              'it turned out to be an excellent choice and I have absolutely '
              'no complaints with it. Actually, the price of the combined '
              'tools was less than buying another Hencklels. There’s not much '
              'you can say about a tool like this other than it does the job, '
              'it feels good in the hand and not using the same tool for '

              'chunky holder and soft grip - which are its good points. I was '
              'also influenced by the plethora of 5 star reviews.  '
              'Unfortunately the swiveling blade is not to my liking - I '
              'understand the logic behind it (I think) ie it is meant to make '
              "peeling odd-shaped potatoes easier. It doesn't. Or at least not "
              'for me. It makes it more difficult - and I have managed to cut '
              'my fingers with it twice because the swiveling blade makes it '

              'three months ago, after I managed to lose (probably thrown away '
              "with the peelings) beloved old Lancashire peeler. I've waited a "
              'bit to review it until I had given it a bit of use. I had tried '
              'a couple of other Lancashire peelers in the interim, but they '
              'felt awkward, and tended to gouge the vegetables. This Oxo '
              "beauty is just extraordinary. I've tackled all sorts of "
              'vegetables and fruit and found it universally effective. I know '
              "it's got a swivel blade that some users complain about, but I "
              'have actually not been conscious of this. I think the secret is '
              'to rely on the natural sharpness of the peeler and its ability '
              'to follow contours, and let it gently do the work and not try '
              'to fight it. I just find it amazingly fast, with the ability to '

              'that is holding the peeler. For my method the ergonomics are '
              'bad and it feels too large (even though I have large hands).',

              'about 8 different types and they have all been thrown in the '

# Sentimental Analysis Of Comments On A Product
 Sentimental Analysis of comments on a product on Amazon

 Amazon offers a vast amount of products to be consumed by users globally. Each product has thousands of variants available and it is inflexible for a buyer to choose a product for themselves from the variety available. The most common technique that a buyer uses is to go through the user comments of a product and choose a product with the best comment ratings. Here, a problem arises that is what if a product has thousands of comments listed; this where sentiment analysis comes into place. We have developed a system that can extract comments from a product and give a graphical analysis of all the comments submerged into a pie chart with the ability to show negative and positively sentiment comments. The system also lists all the comments along with their sentiment i.e. negative or positive. Currently, the system does product false negative results due to limited data-set and quality of the words in the data-set which is being used to train the model based on a na√Øve bayes classifier.
